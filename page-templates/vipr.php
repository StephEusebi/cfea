			<p class="cell large-10 progDesc">The disparity between movement and power exercises is linked by ViPR. 
			It merges complete body movement with weight, thereby improving the vivacity, implementation along with 
			overhauling the aspirations of customers and sportspeople. ViPR ushers in a new perception in fitness and 
			athletic training â€“ Loaded Movement Training.</p>
			<p class="cell large-10 progDesc">Loaded Movement Training blends movements that are adapted for resilient 
			exercises. Quickness and power originate from the body as it moves in a variety of focused undertakings with 
			weight, just like back at the homestead.</p>
			<p class="cell large-10 progDesc">ViPR was stimulated by farm youngsters who moved with weights on a daily 
			basis and who were more powerful than any other contender in athletics. Using ViPR, we can turn out 
			farm-toughened physique everywhere, sans setting foot on a farm, without having to carry out any hard work in 
			an entertaining, harmless and efficient style.</p>
			<p class="cell large-10 progDesc">As Michol Dalcourt, the creator of ViPR clarifies; the art of movement 
			reinforces incorporating Loaded Movement Training by using ViPR into existing exercise procedures for all 
			fitness objectives.</p>
