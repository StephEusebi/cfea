			<h1 class="cell large-12 progDesc">ViPR</h1>
			<p class="cell large-12 progDesc">The disparity between movement and power exercises is linked by ViPR. It merges complete body 
			movement with weight, thereby improving the vivacity, implementation along with overhauling the 
			aspirations of customers and sportspeople. ViPR ushers in a new perception in fitness and athletic 
			training – Loaded Movement Training.</p>

			<p class="cell large-12 progDesc">Loaded Movement Training blends movements that are adapted for resilient exercises. Quickness and 
			power originate from the body as it moves in a variety of focused undertakings with weight, just like 
			back at the homestead.</p>

			<p class="cell large-12 progDesc">ViPR was stimulated by farm youngsters who moved with weights on a daily basis and who were more powerful 
			than any other contender in athletics. Using ViPR, we can turn out farm-toughened physique everywhere, sans 
			setting foot on a farm, without having to carry out any hard work in an entertaining, harmless and efficient 
			style.</p>

			<p class="cell large-12 progDesc">As Michol Dalcourt, the creator of ViPR clarifies; the art of movement reinforces incorporating Loaded 
			Movement Training by using ViPR into existing exercise procedures for all fitness objectives.</p>
